      I studied Computer Science at Kyungpook National University. When I was in school, I was interested in web development so I studied intensively.

      <p>
      Besides that, I own a Blog where I study web development. I try my best to give a good insight into how I think about working with certain problems. I help then getting into Javascript as well with server-side stuff.

        When Iâ€™m not working I still code some of my personal projects. Programming is more than just a work for me, this is a hobby, itâ€™s a passion. But if Iâ€™m not in front of a computer I pass all my time doing excercise.<span role="img" aria-label="Snowman">ðŸ˜ƒ</span>.

      <h4>Why having this blog?</h4>
      <p>
      This blog is a place for me to write down what I think. This helps me first with my English who is not my native language, and that also help me empty my brain. By doing this I hope I can help people with some of the thinking, tutorial or whatever stuff I wrote here.
